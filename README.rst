This is just a collection of scripts that I might have found useful at some
moment. All of them are relased under the BOLA_ license.

If you have any comments, patches or suggestions let me know at:
rodrigo@sdfg.com.ar. Please keep in mind that most should be a 10 minutes hack
(or even less :D), so the code might not be the prettiest one :-)

Here is a list of some of the scripts you can find:

 * ``notifyme``: Run any command and open an X window to notify when it
   finishes. You can also snooze for 1 minute.

 * ``crous-login``: The CROUS_ students residence force you to fill a form every
   time you want to login and every N hours. This scripts just fills the forms
   for you whenever needed.

 * ``batrat``: Check if the system is running on AC or batteries and print to
   stdout whenever the system switches from AC to BAT or viceversa. Uses inotify
   to detect switches.
